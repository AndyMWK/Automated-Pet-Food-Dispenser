# Automated Pet Food Dispenser Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to dispense pet food twice a day at a set time. It also includes a checking system where it checks for pet food in the bowl before it dispense. This functionality is implemented because feeding twice the amount of the regular amount may be undesireable. 

## Technical Specificcs
The program uses an real time clock unit (RTC DS3231), Servo Motor, and Ultrasonic Sensor to detect and dispense pet food. Current construction is made out of cardboard. It also includes an LED light to indicate that the pet food detection and dispensing process has begun.

## Libraries Used
All libraries for this project either come with the Arduino IDE or downloaded through the library manager of the Arduino IDE. I have not written a library function for this project.
